Minecraft was written in Java, so I spent countless hours trying to get the development environment setup in Eclipse with great difficulty. Once I had it working though, it felt like magic, I got quickly bored and wanted a bit more of a challenge. It’s a little embarrassing that Minecraft is what got me interested in video games, but honestly without it, I might never have found game programming.",short:"I started programming by adding items/models/recipes to minecraft learning java but it quickly became boring and I yearned for a challenge."},{header:"A New Foe Has Appeared",long:"After working with Java for a while outside of the minecraft realm, I decided I really wanted more of a challenge, the obvious next steps would be to take a small incremental step like learning C#, but not for me. I wanted to go straight to C++ which was extremely challenging. It forced me to re-evaluate how I approached programming and gave me a newfound appreciation for game programmers. But now in hind-sight, it was probably the best thing I could have done, spending every waking hour trying to get my head around the language really taught me a great deal of persistence is required sometimes to get the job done and it's almost never easy haha.",short:"Java was great, but C++ completely changed my view of programming, forcing me to re-evaluate my approach to programming and taught me that a great deal of persistence is required when learning new things."},{header:"Finding The Artist Within",long:"Working in C++ for a while was great, but it wasn’t hitting all the right buttons.

Luckily enough, I was still a student at the time and I could get access to 3DS Max and Maya for free, so off I went, trial and error watching hours of digital tutors content that I begged my parents to buy me.

It empowered me to focus forthrightly on learning unreal and I loved every moment of it. And then, to top it off a new version of unreal engine 4 had just come out and was a revolutionary jump in quality, but it was a bit out of my price range, so thanks to some amazing folks at Epic Games, I was able to get my hands on an early UE4 key. Only for it to become completely free a short time later.<br/><br/>I still vividly remember waiting all night for Unreal Engine 4 to download and opening up the engine for the first time and playing around with the starter content.
